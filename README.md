## 📌 Project Summary

An AI-powered web application designed to reduce food waste and optimize inventory management for restaurants. This system intelligently forecasts demand, recommends menu items based on stock, detects anomalies, and performs real-time feedback analysis. It brings together **machine learning**, **natural language processing**, and an **interactive web interface** to drive efficient, sustainable operations in the food service industry.

---

## 💡 Motivation

The rising levels of food waste and inefficiencies in restaurant supply chains called for a smarter solution. This project was born out of the need to:

- Combat food spoilage and inventory overstocking
- Improve sustainability in the hospitality industry
- Empower restaurants to make **data-driven decisions**
- Forecast demand with high accuracy based on external factors like weather and holidays
- Minimize environmental impact and operational costs

## 👨‍💻 What I Did

- 📊 Collected, cleaned, and preprocessed real-world restaurant inventory & sales data  
- 🧠 Built & trained ML models: **Random Forest**, **Collaborative Filtering**, **Isolation Forest**  
- 🔍 Developed demand prediction engine factoring in holidays, weekdays & weather  
- 🤖 Designed a recommendation engine based on predicted demand + inventory  
- ⚠️ Implemented anomaly detection to flag irregular inventory patterns  
- 💬 Built a **feedback analyzer** using NLP (TF-IDF) for improving future recommendations  
- 🌐 Created a **Streamlit web app** for real-time access and use  
- 📦 Used GitHub for version control and collaboration  
- 👥 Led a team of 4, serving as **Lead Developer and UI Designer**
