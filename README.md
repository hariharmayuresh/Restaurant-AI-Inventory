## 📌 Project Summary

An AI-powered web application designed to reduce food waste and optimize inventory management for restaurants. This system intelligently forecasts demand, recommends menu items based on stock, detects anomalies, and performs real-time feedback analysis. It brings together **machine learning**, **natural language processing**, and an **interactive web interface** to drive efficient, sustainable operations in the food service industry.

---

## 💡 Motivation

The rising levels of food waste and inefficiencies in restaurant supply chains called for a smarter solution. This project was born out of the need to:

- Combat food spoilage and inventory overstocking
- Improve sustainability in the hospitality industry
- Empower restaurants to make **data-driven decisions**
- Forecast demand with high accuracy based on external factors like weather and holidays
- Minimize environmental impact and operational costs

---

## 👨‍💻 What I Did

- 📊 Collected and cleaned 5,000+ rows of restaurant sales data, including weather and holiday features  
- 🧠 Built & trained ML models: Random Forest with 85%+ accuracy in menu demand prediction and < 5.5 MAE on unseen data
- 🗂️ Designed a 4-module system: Demand Prediction, Menu Recommendation, Alerts, and Feedback Analysis  
- 🔍 Developed demand prediction engine factoring in holidays, weekdays & weather  
- 🤖 Designed a recommendation engine using 95+ real-world-inspired menu items based on predicted demand + inventory
- 💬 Built a **feedback analyzer** using NLP (TF-IDF) for improving future recommendations  
- 🌐 Created a **Streamlit web app** for real-time access and use  
- 📦 Used GitHub for version control and collaboration

## ✅ Key Features

- 📅 **Demand Prediction** – ML-powered forecasts based on historical sales data  
- 📋 **Menu Recommendations** – Suggest dishes based on available inventory stock  
- 📉 **Alert Mechanism** – notifies when inventory is low or items are near expiry 
- 💬 **Feedback Analyzer** – Understand customer sentiment via NLP  
- 🧠 **ML Integration** – Modular models: Random Forest and TF-IDF  
- 🔗 **Scalable & Real-time** – Works with live inventory data and user inputs

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech Used

- **Python**  
- **Streamlit** – Web app framework  
- **Scikit-learn** – ML model training  
- **Pandas / NumPy** – Data processing  
- **NLP** – TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Visualizations  
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control  
- **Google Colab / VS Code** – Development environment

---

## 🧠 Use Cases

- 🍴 Restaurants planning menus based on daily/seasonal demand  
- 📉 Prevent overproduction by aligning inventory with predictions
- 🔔 Inventory teams alerted in real-time about low stock or expiry
- 📬 Feedback analysis helps management understand operational gaps
