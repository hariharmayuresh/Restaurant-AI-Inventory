## 📌 Project Summary

An AI-powered web application designed to reduce food waste and optimize inventory management for restaurants. This system intelligently forecasts demand, recommends menu items based on stock, detects anomalies, and performs real-time feedback analysis. It brings together **machine learning**, **natural language processing**, and an **interactive web interface** to drive efficient, sustainable operations in the food service industry.

---

## 💡 Motivation

The rising levels of food waste and inefficiencies in restaurant supply chains called for a smarter solution. This project was born out of the need to:

- Combat food spoilage and inventory overstocking
- Improve sustainability in the hospitality industry
- Empower restaurants to make **data-driven decisions**
- Forecast demand with high accuracy based on external factors like weather and holidays
- Minimize environmental impact and operational costs

## 👨‍💻 What I Did

- 📊 Collected and cleaned 5,000+ rows of restaurant sales data, including weather and holiday features  
- 🧠 Built & trained ML models: Random Forest with 85%+ accuracy in menu demand prediction and < 5.5 MAE on unseen data
- 🗂️ Designed a 4-module system: Demand Prediction, Menu Recommendation, Alerts, and Feedback Analysis  
- 🔍 Developed demand prediction engine factoring in holidays, weekdays & weather  
- 🤖 Designed a recommendation engine using 95+ real-world-inspired menu items based on predicted demand + inventory
- 💬 Built a **feedback analyzer** using NLP (TF-IDF) for improving future recommendations  
- 🌐 Created a **Streamlit web app** for real-time access and use  
- 📦 Used GitHub for version control and collaboration
